# Vedik-Cyber-Forces-Project
This is a project to create a basic community website server. eg. if you want to make a community with you friends in college then you can directly use this source code to start up with a basic community website you do not need to start from the start. Vedik Cyber Forces project is the easiest way to get a fully working new community website.

# How to set up the vidik cyber forces project:

 3. Go to the startdatabase folder and open the given sql file in any text editor
    then copy the code and then go to the phpmyadmin of the xampp servers create a new database or just use the given test
    database click on that database then click on the sql option of the menu bar and paste all the code and then hit the go
    button after this all the required tables will be automatically created and filled with example data.
